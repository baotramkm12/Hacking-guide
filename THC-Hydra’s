RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol
hydra -t 4 -V -f -l administrator -P rockyou.txt rdp://192.168.34.16

-t 4 This sets the number of tasks that can run parallel together in this example I have used 4 which will send 4 logins at a time. RDP does not like too many connections at the same time so try and keep it at a maximum of 4. It is sometimes worth adding a -w to your command to add a wait between attempts.
-V – Verbose this shows you which usernames and passwords on screen as it’s working.
-f  Quits once you have found a positive Username and Password match.
-l administrator – Use the username administrator to attempt to login.
-P rockyou.txt– This is the word list that we will be pulling passwords from.
rdp://192.168.34.16 – This is the service we want to attack and the IP address.

FTP: File Transfer Protocol
hydra -t 5 -V -f -L userlist -P passwordlist ftp://192.168.34.16

-t 5 this sets the number of tasks or logins it will try simultaneously. I have gone for 5 here but just remember don’t go too high as it may give you false results.
-V Verbose this will display the login and password it tries in the terminal for each attempt/
-f Quits once hydra has found a positive Username and Password match.
-L userlist The capital -L  here means I’m using a wordlist of usernames called userlist if a -l was used this specifies a single username to try.
-P passwordlist The capital -P here means I’m using a word list called passwordlist if a -p was used this specifies a single password to try.
ftp://192.168.34.16 This is the service we want to attack and the IP address of the FTP server

VNC
hydra -P passwordlist -t 1 -w 5 -f -s 5901 192.168.100.155 vnc -v

-P passwordlist The capital -P here means I’m using a word list called passwordlist if a -p was used this specifies a single password to try.
-t 1 This sets the number of tasks or logins it will try simultaneously. I have gone for 1 here but just remember don’t go higher than 4 for brute forcing VNC.
-w 5 This sets the wait time between tries I have gone for 5 here but remember to go a lot higher if the blacklisting feature is still enabled
-f Quits once hydra has found a positive Password match.
-s 5901 This changes the default port for hydra to connect to the VNC server from 5900 to 5901 which was what my VNC server defaulted to.
192.168.100.155 vnc This specifies the IP address of the VNC server and the service we want to attack.
-v Verbose this will display the password it tries in the terminal for each attempt.

SSH: secure shell
hydra -l admin -P passwordlist ssh://192.168.100.155 -V

-l admin The small l here states that I am going to specify a username use a capital L if you are going to specify a user list.
-P passwordlist The capital P here says I’m going to be specifying a list of passwords in a file called passwordlist.
ssh://192.168.100.155 This is the service we want to attack and the IP address of the SSH server.
-V Verbose this will display the login and password it tries in the terminal for each attempt.

Webpage Login
hydra 192.168.100.155 -V -l admin -P passwordlist http-get-form "/dvwa/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:F=Username and/or password incorrect.:H=Cookie: PHPSESSID=rjevaetqb3dqbj1ph3nmjchel2; security=low"

192.168.100.155 The target IP address of the server hosting the webpage
-V Verbose this will display the login and password it tries in the terminal for each attempt.
-l admin The small l here states that I am going to specify a username use a capital L if you are going to specify a user list.
-P passwordlist The capital P here says I’m going to be specifying a list of passwords in a file called passwordlist.
http-get-form Tells hydra that you are going to be using the http-get-form module.
/dvwa/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login All these details were found in our tamper data request that we copied to our text editor.
F=Username and/or password incorrect. This is the failed login message we received from the DVWA login page, this tells hydra when it’s not received we have a valid login.
H=Cookie: PHPSESSID=rjevaetqb3dqbj1ph3nmjchel2; security=low This is the Cookie we were issued when we logged into the DVWA site at the start also found in the Tamper Data.
